# Minify
Spotify Mini Player for OSX

Basic mini player for spotify. Features:
- Previous, next, play and pause configurations. 
- Basic song info (album cover, song and artist name)

Requirement:
- Working spotify program
- Applescript : Path to applescript must be "/usr/bin/osascript", otherwise you should change it from SongView.swift 

PS: Since the program uses applescripts behind, program is not fast enough. For those interested, the main concern is making program faster. To do this, there should be an alternative for applescripts. 
In future updates, I will try to add the playlist info and allow you to change playlist from mini player. I added main problems that i need for now. You can easily fork and help this project to grow.
